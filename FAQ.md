## How can I override the path to the AfterFx executable?

There is a feature within the After Effects Deadline Cloud package that allows you the ability to
set the `AFTERFX_EXECUTABLE` environment variable and point to the after effects
AfterFx.exe executable directly.

The recommended route is still to ensure that `afterfx` is in your system path, however some clients
have found it easier to set an environment variable directly instead.
